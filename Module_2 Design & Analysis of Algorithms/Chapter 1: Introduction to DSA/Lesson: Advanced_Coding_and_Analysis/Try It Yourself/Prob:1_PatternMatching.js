/*
You are a software engineer working on a new search engine. You need to write a function that checks 
if a given string contains a specific pattern. The pattern could be a word, a phrase, or even a regular 
expression. The function will be used to filter out search results that do not contain the desired 
pattern. For example, if the pattern is "dog", the function would return true for the string 
"I love dogs", but it would return false for the string "I love cats".
